# Kattis

I have made some Kattis task in cpp. It's updating for time to time when I do more task.

## What I use

For most of the task:

- cph extension both chrome and vscode to easily access the problem and get test cases.
- snippets extension where it allows me to easierly make a template of my choice.
- Lastly I use my shell scipt to move the .cpp files over in the done folder and temporary in the extra_copy folder to easily check the last assignment I did.

## Final remark

Most of the things I have is still a work in progress, hope it helps somewhat if you're stuck at a problem and need some insight.

### CHEERS!!!
